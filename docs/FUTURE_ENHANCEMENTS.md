# Future Enhancements - Maintenance System

This document outlines planned enhancements and improvements for the vehicle maintenance tracking system.

## üéõÔ∏è Customizable Maintenance Intervals

### Overview
Currently, maintenance intervals are hardcoded in the application. A future enhancement will allow users to customize these intervals based on their specific vehicle requirements, driving conditions, and preferences.

### Proposed Features

#### 1. User-Configurable Intervals
- **Per-Vehicle Settings**: Different vehicles may have different maintenance requirements
- **Custom Time Intervals**: Allow users to set custom month intervals (e.g., 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 months)
- **Custom Mileage Intervals**: Allow users to set custom mileage intervals (e.g., 3000, 5000, 7500, 10000 miles)
- **Mixed Intervals**: Support for services that are time-only, mileage-only, or both

#### 2. Warning Threshold Customization
- **Adjustable Yellow Warning**: Currently set at 75-90%, allow users to customize (e.g., 70%, 80%, 85%)
- **Adjustable Red Overdue**: Currently set at 100%, allow users to set grace periods (e.g., 110%, 120%)
- **Per-Service Thresholds**: Different warning levels for different maintenance types

#### 3. Vehicle-Specific Presets
- **Manufacturer Recommendations**: Pre-populated intervals based on vehicle make/model/year
- **Driving Condition Presets**:
  - **Severe Conditions**: Shorter intervals for city driving, extreme weather, towing
  - **Normal Conditions**: Standard manufacturer recommendations
  - **Highway Conditions**: Extended intervals for primarily highway driving
- **Oil Type Considerations**: Different intervals for conventional vs synthetic oil
- **Electric Vehicle Presets**: Specialized maintenance schedules for EVs (see Electric Vehicle Support section)

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- New table for storing custom intervals
CREATE TABLE maintenance_intervals (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  car_id UUID REFERENCES cars(id),
  maintenance_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  months INTEGER,
  miles INTEGER,
  yellow_threshold DECIMAL(3,2) DEFAULT 0.80,
  red_threshold DECIMAL(3,2) DEFAULT 1.00,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Default system intervals table
CREATE TABLE default_maintenance_intervals (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  maintenance_type VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  months INTEGER,
  miles INTEGER,
  yellow_threshold DECIMAL(3,2) DEFAULT 0.80,
  red_threshold DECIMAL(3,2) DEFAULT 1.00,
  description TEXT,
  category VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'standard'
);
```

#### Phase 2: User Interface Components
- **Settings Page**: New maintenance settings section
- **Interval Editor**: Form to modify intervals per vehicle
- **Preset Selector**: Dropdown for driving condition presets
- **Threshold Sliders**: Visual controls for warning thresholds
- **Preview Mode**: Show how changes affect current status

#### Phase 3: Backend Logic Updates
- **Interval Resolution**: Logic to check custom intervals first, then defaults
- **Validation**: Ensure intervals are reasonable (e.g., oil change can't be 2 years)
- **Migration Tools**: Convert existing data to new system
- **API Endpoints**: CRUD operations for custom intervals

### User Experience Flow

- **User Engagement**: More customization leads to higher user investment

### Migration Strategy

#### Backward Compatibility
- Current hardcoded intervals remain as system defaults
- Existing users automatically get current intervals as their custom settings
- Gradual rollout with opt-in beta testing

#### Data Preservation
- All existing maintenance records remain unchanged
- Status calculations continue to work during transition
- No disruption to current functionality

### Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 1 (Database)**: 2-3 weeks
